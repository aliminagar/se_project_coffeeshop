Triple Peaks Coffee Shop
Project Description
The Triple Peaks Coffee Shop project is a multi-page website developed as part of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. The website showcases a fictional coffee shop targeted at an elderly audience, with the goal of providing a user-friendly and accessible experience. The site includes several pages, such as the homepage, about, menu, and contact form.

The website was created using HTML5 and CSS3 technologies, and follows best practices in terms of web development, including responsive design, semantic HTML, and styling through Flexbox and CSS animations.

Project Features:
Semantic HTML5 for better readability and accessibility.
Flexbox and Positioning for layout design and responsiveness.
Flat BEM File Structure for organized and scalable CSS.
Custom Form with validation to handle customer inquiries.
CSS Animations and Transforms to enhance user experience.
Images and SVG Icons for a professional look and feel.
Plans for Improving the Project
Add JavaScript Functionality: Introduce dynamic content like a live menu, with options to sort items by price or popularity.
Accessibility Enhancements: Implement screen reader support, optimize for keyboard navigation, and add an adjustable font size feature for elderly users.
Additional Styling and Features: Implement more CSS transitions and hover effects for a more engaging user experience.
Database Integration: Plan to integrate a back-end system (such as Firebase or Node.js) for handling online orders and reservations directly through the website.
